<p><b>Macaws</b> are a group of New World parrots that are long-tailed and often colorful. [1] They are popular in aviculture or as companion parrots, although there arE 
    conservation concerns about several species in the wild.Of the many different Psittacidae (true parrots) genera, six are classified as macaws: Ara, Anodorhynchus,
      Cyanopsitta, Primolius, Orthopsittaca, and Diopsittaca. Previously, the members of the genus Primolius were placed in Propyrrhura, but the former is correct in accordance 
      with ICZN rules.[2] In addition, the related macaw-like thick-billed parrot is sometimes referred to as a "macaw", although it is not phylogenetically considered to be a macaw 
      species. Macaws are native to Central America and North America (only Mexico), South America, and formerly the Caribbean. Most species are associated with forests, but others 
      prefer woodland or savannah-like habitats.[3] Proportionately larger beaks, long tails,and relatively bare, light-coloured medial (facial patch) areas distinguish macaws from other 
     parrots. Sometimes the facial patch is smaller in some species and limited to a yellow patch around the eyes and a second patch near the base of the beak in the members of the genus 
     Anodorhynchus. A macaw's facial feather pattern is as unique as a fingerprint.[4] The largest macaws are the hyacinth, Buffon's (great green) and green-winged macaws. While still 
    relatively large parrots, mini-macaws of the genera Cyanopsitta, Orthopsittaca and Primolius are significantly smaller than the members of Anodorhynchus and Ara. The smallest member of the 
    family, the red-shouldered macaw, is no larger than some parakeets of the genus Aratinga.[3] Macaws, like other parrots, toucans and woodpeckers, are zygodactyl, having their first and 
    fourth toes pointing backward.
